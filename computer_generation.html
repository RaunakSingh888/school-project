                important invention
                in the computer field. The first IC was invented and used in 1961. The size of an IC is about Â¼ square inch. A
                single
                IC chip may contain thousands of transistors. The computer became smaller in size, faster, more reliable and
                less expensive.

                It was known as Intel 4004. The technology of integrated circuits improved rapidly. The LSI (Large Scale
                Integration) circuit and
                VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) circuit was designed. It greatly reduced the size of computer. The size of
                modern Microprocessors
                is usually one square inch. It can contain millions of electronic circuits. The examples of fourth generation
