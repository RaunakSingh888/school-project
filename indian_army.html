            <p>The Indian army is land based branch and largest component of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Armed_Forces">Indian
                    Armed Forces</a>
                The prsident of indoa is supreme commander of the indian army, and it is commanded by the chief of Army
                staff (CAOS), who is a four-star general. Two officers have been conferred with the rank of field
                marshal,a five-star rank ,which is a ceremonial position of great honour. The Indian Army originated
                from the armies of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_India_Company">East India Company</a>,
                which eventually became <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Indian_Army">British India Army
                </a> and the armies of the princely states, which finally became the national army after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_of_India">Independence</a>.
                The units and regiments of the Indian Army have diverse histories and have participated in a number of
                battles and campaigns across the world, earning a large number of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_and_theatre_honours_of_the_Indian_Army">Battle
                    and theatre honours</a> before and after independence.</p>

            <p>The primary mission of the indian army is to ensure <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Council_(India)">national
                    security</a> and national unity, defending the nation from external aggression and internal
                therats, and ,maintaining peace and security within its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Borders_of_India">borders</a>
                . It conducts humanitarian rescue operations during natural calamities and other disturbances, like <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Surya_Hope"> operation surya hope</a>, and can also
                be requisitioned by the government to cope with internal threats. It is a major component of national
                power alongside the <a href="http://localhost/school-html-project/indian_navy.html">Indian Navy</a> and
                the <a href="indian_air_force.html">Indian air force</a> The army
                has been involved in four wars with neighbouring Pakistan and one with China. Other major operations
                undertaken by the army include: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Vijay_(1961)">operation
                    vijay</a>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Meghdoot">operation meghdoot</a> and <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Cactus">operation cactus</a>. Apart from conflicts,
                the army has conducted large peace time exercises like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Brasstacks">operation
                    Brasstacks</a> and Exercise Shoorveer, and it has also been an active participant in numerous <a

                    Nations peacekeeping missions</a> including those in: Cyprus, Lebanon, Congo, Angola, Cambodia,
                Vietnam, Namibia, El Salvador, Liberia, Mozambique and Somalia.</p>

            <p>The Indian Army has a regimental system, but is operationally and geographically divided into seven
                commands, with the basic field formation being a division. It is an all-volunteer force and comprises
                more than 80% of the country's active defence personnel. It is the 2nd largest standing army in the
                world, with 1,237,117 active troops and 960,000 reserve troops.[11][12] The army has embarked on
                an infantry modernisation program known as Futuristic Infantry Soldier As a System (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-INSAS">F-INSAS</a>)
                , and is also upgrading and acquiring new assets for its armoured, artillery and aviation branches.</p>

            <p>A Military Department was created within the Government of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_India_Company">East
                    India Company </a>in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata">Kolkata</a> n the year 1776.
                Its main function was to sift and record orders relating to the Army that were issued by various
                Departments of the East India Company for the territories under its control.</p>

            <p>With the Charter Act of 1833, the Secretariat of the Government of the East India Company was
                reorganised into four Departments, including a Military Department. The army in the Presidencies of <a

                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madras_Presidency">Madaras</a> functioned as respective
                Presidency Armies until 1 April 1895 when they were unified into a single <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Indian_Army">Indian
                    Army </a> For administrative convenience, it was divided into four commands at that point, namely
                Punjab (including the North West Frontier), Bengal, Madras (including Burma) and Bombay (including
                Sind, Quetta and Aden).</p>
               

            <p>The British Indian Army was a critical force for the primacy of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire">British
                    Empire</a> both in India and across the world. Besides maintaining the internal security of the <a

                theatres: the Anglo-Burmese Wars, First and Second Anglo-Sikh Wars, First, Second and Third
                Anglo-Afghan Wars, First and Second Opium Wars in China, Abyssinia, and the Boxer Rebellion in China.</p>

            <strong style="color:royalblue;"></strong>World Wars</strong><br />

            <p>In the 20th century, the Indian Army was a crucial adjunct to the British forces in both world wars. 1.3
                million Indian soldiers served in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I">World War I </a>(1914–1918)
                with the Allies, in which 74,187 Indian troops were killed or missing in action.[22] In 1915 there was
                a mutiny by Indian soldiers in Singapore. The United Kingdom made promises of self-governance to the
                Indian National Congress in return for its support but reneged on them after the war, following which
                the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_independence_movement#First_World_War">Indian
                    Independence movement </a> gained strength</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianisation_(British_India)">Indianisation</a> of the
                British Indian Army began with the formation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Wales_Royal_Indian_Military_College">
                    Prince of Wales Royal Indian Military College</a> at Dehradun in March 1912 with the purpose of
                providing education to the scions of aristocratic and well-to-do Indian families, and to prepare
                selected Indian boys for admission into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Military_College,_Sandhurst">
                    Royal Military College, Sandhurst.</a>Indian officers were given a King's commission after passing
                out and were posted to one of the eight units selected for Indianisation. Because of the slow pace of
                Indianisation, with just 69 officers being commissioned between 1918 and 1932, political pressure was
                applied leading to the formation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Military_Academy">Indian
                    Military Academy</a> Academy in 1932 and greater numbers of officers of Indian origin being
                commissioned.</p>

            <p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II">World War ll</a> Indian soldiers fought
                alongside the Allies. In 1939, British officials had no plan for expansion and training of Indian
                forces, which comprised about 130,000 men (in addition there were 44,000 men in British units in India
                in 1939). Their mission was internal security and defence against a possible Soviet threat through
                Afghanistan. As the war progressed, the size and role of the Indian Army expanded dramatically, and
                troops were sent to battlefronts as soon as possible. The most serious problem was lack of
                equipment.[24] Indian units served in Burma, where in 1944–45, five Indian divisions were engaged along
                with one British and three African divisions. Even larger numbers operated in the Middle East. Some
                87,000 Indian soldiers died in the war. By the end of the war it had become the largest volunteer army
                in history, rising to over 2.5 million men in August 1945.</p>

            <p>In the African and Middle-Eastern Campaigns, captured Indian troops were given a choice to join the <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Army_(Wehrmacht)">German Army</a> to eventually
                "liberate" India from Great Britain instead of being sent to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POW_camp">POW
                    camps</a> These men, along with Indian students who were in Germany when the war broke out, made up
                what was called the Free India Legion. They were originally intended as pathfinders for German forces
                in Asia, but were soon sent to help guard the Atlantic Wall. Few who were part of the Free India Legion
                ever saw any combat, and very few were ever stationed outside Europe. At its height the Free India
                Legion had over 3,000 troops in its ranks</p>

            <p>Indian POWs also joined the Indian National Army which was allied with the Empire of Japan. It was
                raised by a former colonel of the British Indian Army (Gen) Mohan Singh, but later led by Netaji Subhas
                Chandra Bose and Rash Bihari Bose. With the fall of Singapore in 1942, about 40,000 Indian soldiers
                were captured. They were given a choice and over 30,000 joined the Indian National Army. Those who
                refused became POWs and were mostly shipped to New Guinea. After initial success it was defeated along
                with the Japanese, but it had a huge impact on the Indian independence movement. Similar organisations
                were also formed in Germany and Japan.</p>

                was disbanded,[29] and Headquarters Delhi and East Punjab Command was formed to administer the area.</p>

            <p>The departure of virtually all senior British officers following independence and their replacement by
                Indian officers meant many of the latter held acting ranks several ranks above their substantive ones.
                For instance, S. M. Shrinagesh, the ground forces commander of Indian forces during the first Indo-Pak
                War of 1947-49 (and the future third COAS) was first an acting major-general and then an acting
                lieutenant-general during the conflict while holding the substantive rank of major, and only received a
                substantive promotion to lieutenant-colonel in August 1949.[30] Gopal Gurunath Bewoor, the future ninth
                COAS, was an acting colonel at his promotion to substantive major from substantive captain in 1949,
                while future lieutenant-general K. P. Candeth was an acting brigadier (substantive captain) at the same
                time.</p>

            <p>Army Day is celebrated on 15 January every year in India, in recognition of Lieutenant General K. M.
                Cariappa's taking over as the first Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army from General Sir Francis
                Butcher, the last British Commander-in-Chief of India, on 15 January 1949. With effect from 26 January
                1950, the date India became a republic, all active-duty Indian Army officers formerly holding the
                King's Commission were recommissioned and confirmed in their substantive ranks.</p>

            <strong style="color:darkgoldenrod;">First Kashmir War (1947)</strong>

            <p>Immediately after independence, tensions between India and Pakistan began to boil over, and the first of
                three full-scale wars between the two nations broke out over the then <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princely_state">
                    princely state of kashmir</a> The Maharaja of Kashmir wanted to have a standstill position. Since
                Kashmir was a Muslim majority state, Pakistan wanted to make Kashmir a Pakistani territory. As a
                result, Pakistan invaded Kashmir on 22 October 1947, causing Maharaja Hari Singh to look to India,
                specifically to Lord Mountbatten of Burma, the governor general, for help. He signed the Instrument of
                Accession to India on 26 October 1947. Indian troops were airlifted to Srinagar from 27 October dawn
                onwards.[33] This contingent included General Thimayya who distinguished himself in the operation and
                in the years that followed became a Chief of the Indian Army. An intense war was waged across the state
                and former comrades found themselves fighting each other. Pakistan suffered significant losses. Its
                forces were stopped on the line formed which is now called LOC (Line of Control).[citation needed] An
                uneasy UN sponsored peace returned by the end of 1948 with Indian and Pakistani soldiers facing each
                other directly on the Line of Control, which has since divided Indian-held Kashmir from Pakistan-held
                Kashmir. A number of UN resolutions (38–47) were passed calling for a plebiscite to be held in Kashmir
                to determine accession to India or Pakistan only after Pakistan withdrew its army from Kashmir.[34] A
                precondition to the resolution was for Pakistan and India to return to a state of "as was" prior to the
                conflict. Pakistan would withdraw all tribesmen and Pakistani nationals brought in to fight in Kashmir.
                With Pakistan refusing to pull back there could be no further dialogue on fulfilling the UN
                resolution.[35][34] Tensions between India and Pakistan, largely over Kashmir, have never been entirely
                eliminated.</p>

            <strong style="color:darkgoldenrod;">Annexation of Hyderabad (1948)</strong>
            <p>Major General El Edroos (at right) offers his surrender of the Hyderabad State Forces to Major General
                (later Army Chief) J.N. Chaudhuri at Secunderabad After the partition of India, the State of Hyderabad,
                a princely state under the rule of a Nizam, chose to remain independent. The Nizam, refused to accede
                his state to the Union of India. The following stand-off between the Government of India and the Nizam
                ended on 12 September 1948 when India's then deputy Prime Minister Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel ordered
                Indian troops to secure the state. During five days of fighting, the Indian Army, backed by an Indian
                Air Force squadron of Hawker Tempest aircraft, routed the Hyderabad State forces. Five Indian Army
                infantry battalions and one armoured squadron were engaged in the operation. The following day, the
                State of Hyderabad was proclaimed as a part of the Union of India. Major General Joyanto Nath
                Chaudhuri, who led the Operation Polo and accepted the surrender of the Nizam's forces on 18 September
                1948, was appointed the military governor of Hyderabad (1948–1949) to restore law and order.</p>

            <strong style="color:darkgoldenrod;">Medical assistance during Korean War (1950–1953)</strong>
            <p>During the Korean War, India sent the 60th Indian (Parachute) Field Ambulance unit to aid the UN troops
                fighting against the Chinese and North Korean invasion of South Korea, though they decided against
                sending combat forces. The 60th PFA was included in the 1st Commonwealth Division. In the aftermath of
                the war, an Indian infantry brigade formed the Custodian Force of India as some of the soldiers were
                also sent to Korea as part of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Committee to assist in the exchange of
                prisoners of war. The NNRC was commanded by Lt Gen KS Thimayya</p>

            <strong style="color:darkgoldenrod;">Annexation of Goa, Daman and Diu (1961)</strong>
            <p>Even though the British and French vacated all their colonial possessions in the Indian subcontinent,
                Portugal refused to relinquish control of its Indian colonies of Goa, Daman and Diu. After repeated
                attempts by India to negotiate with Portugal for the territory were spurned by Portuguese prime
                minister and dictator, António de Oliveira Salazar, India launched Operation Vijay on 12 December 1961
                to take Goa from the Portuguese. A small contingent of its troops entered Goa, Daman, and Diu to
                capture and secure the territory. After a brief conflict, in which 31 Portuguese soldiers were killed,
                the Portuguese Navy frigate NRP Afonso de Albuquerque destroyed, and over 3,000 Portuguese captured,
                Portuguese General Manuel António Vassalo e Silva surrendered to Maj Gen KP Candeth (Kunhiraman Palat
                Kandoth) of the Indian Army, after twenty-six hours. Goa, Daman and Diu became a part of the Republic
                of India.</p>

            <strong style="color:darkgoldenrod;">Sino-Indian War (1962)</strong>
            <p>The cause of this war was a dispute over the sovereignty of the widely separated Aksai Chin and
                Arunachal Pradesh border regions. Aksai Chin, claimed by India to belong to Kashmir, and by China to be
                part of Xinjiang, contains an important road link that connects the Chinese regions of Tibet and
                Xinjiang. China's construction of this road was one of the triggers of the conflict.</p>

            <p>Small-scale clashes between Indian and Chinese forces broke out as India insisted on the disputed
                McMahon Line being regarded as the international border between the two countries. Chinese troops
                claimed not to have retaliated to the cross-border firing by Indian troops, despite sustaining losses.
                China's suspicion of India's involvement in Tibet created more rifts between the two countries.</p>

            <p>In 1962, the Indian Army was ordered to move to the Thag La ridge located near the border between Bhutan
                and Arunachal Pradesh and about three miles (5 km) north of the disputed McMahon Line. Meanwhile,
                Chinese troops had also made incursions into Indian-held territory, and tensions between the two
                reached a new high when Indian forces discovered a road constructed by China in Aksai Chin. After a
                series of failed negotiations, the People's Liberation Army attacked Indian Army positions at the Thag
                La ridge. This move by China caught India by surprise and by 12 October, Nehru gave orders for the
                Chinese to be expelled from Aksai Chin. However, poor co-ordination among various divisions of the
                Indian Army, and the late decision to mobilise the Indian Air Force in vast numbers, gave China a
                crucial tactical and strategic advantage over India. On 20 October, Chinese soldiers attacked India in
                both the North-West and North-Eastern parts of the border and captured vast portions of Aksai Chin and
                Arunachal Pradesh.</p>

            <p>As the fighting moved beyond disputed territories, China called on the Indian government to negotiate,
                however India remained determined to regain lost territory. With no peaceful agreement in sight, China
                unilaterally withdrew its forces from Arunachal Pradesh. The reasons for the withdrawal are disputed
                with India claiming various logistical problems for China and diplomatic support from the United
                States, while China stated that it still held territory it had staked diplomatic claim over. The
                dividing line between the Indian and Chinese forces was named the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_of_Actual_Control"></a>

                <p>The poor decisions made by India's military commanders and, its political leadership, raised several
                    questions. The Henderson-Brooks & Bhagat committee was soon set up by the Government of India to
                    determine the causes of the poor performance of the Indian Army. Its report criticised the decision
                    not to allow the Indian Air Force to target Chinese transport lines out of fear of a Chinese aerial
                    counter-attack on Indian civilian areas. Much of the blame was also targeted at the incompetence of
                    then-Defence Minister, Krishna Menon who resigned from his post soon after the war ended. Despite
                    frequent calls for its release, the Henderson-Brooks report still remains classified.[38] Neville
                    Maxwell has written an account of the war.<p>

                            <p style="color: black;font-size: 11px;">The Indian Army captured a Police Station in<br />Lahore, Pakistan after winning
                                the  of Burki in<br />the 1965 War. It was left by them after the<br /> signing
                                of the Tashkent Declaration.</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>A second confrontation with Pakistan took place in 1965. Although the war is described as
                            inconclusive, India had the better of the war and was a clear winner in tactical and
                            strategic terms. Pakistani President Ayub Khan launched Operation Gibraltar in August 1965,
                            during which several Pakistani paramilitary troops infiltrated into Indian-administered
                            Kashmir and attempt to ignite an anti-India agitation in Jammu and Kashmir. Pakistani
                            leaders believed that India, which was still recovering from the disastrous Sino-Indian
                            War, would be unable to deal with a military thrust and a Kashmiri rebellion. India reacted
                            swiftly and launched a counter offensive on Pakistan. Pakistan launched Operation Grand
                            Slam in reply on 1 September, invading India's Chamb-Jaurian sector. In retaliation, the
                            Indian Army launched a major offensive throughout its border with Pakistan, with Lahore as
                            its prime target.</p>

                        <p>Initially, the Indian Army met with considerable success in the northern sector. After
                            launching prolonged artillery barrages against Pakistan, India was able to capture three
                            important mountain positions in Kashmir. By 9 September, the Indian Army had made
                            considerable in-roads into Pakistan. India had its largest haul of Pakistani tanks when the
                            offensive of Pakistan's 1st Armoured Division was blunted at the Battle of Asal Uttar,
                            which took place on 10 September near Khemkaran.The biggest tank battle of the war came in
                            the form of the Battle of Chawinda, the largest tank battle in history after World War II.
                            Pakistan's defeat at the Battle of Asal Uttar hastened the end of the conflict.</p>

                        <p>At the time of ceasefire declaration, per neutral sources, India reported casualties of
                            about 3,000. On the other hand, it was estimated that more than 3,800 Pakistani soldiers
                            were killed in the battle.]About 200-300 Pakistani tanks were either destroyed or captured
                            by India. India lost a total of 150-190 tanks during the conflict. The decision to return
                            to pre-war positions, following the Tashkent Declaration, caused an outcry among the
                            polity[who?] in New Delhi. It was widely believed that India's decision to accept the
                            ceasefire was due to political factors, and not military, since it was facing considerable
                            pressure from the United States and the UN to stop hostilities</p>

                        <strong style="color:darkgoldenrod;">1967 Sino-Indian Conflict</strong>
                        <p>The 1967 Sino-Indian skirmish, also known as the Cho La incident, was a military conflict
                            between Indian troops and members of the Chinese People's Liberation Army who had
                            infiltrated on 1 October 1967 in Sikkim, then a protectorate of India. On 10 October, both
                            sides clashed again. Defence Minister Sardar Swaran Singh assured the Indian people that
                            the government was taking care of developments along the border. In the aftermath of the
                            conflict Indian losses were 88 killed, and 163 wounded, while Chinese casualties were 300
                            killed and 450 wounded in Nathula, and 40 in Chola. The Chinese Army left Sikkim after
                            being defeated by Indian troops.</p>

                        <p>Under the supervision of Indira Gandhi during the president's rule in 1971, the Indian Army
                            and the Indian police launched Operation Steeplechase, a gigantic "counter-insurgency"
                            operation against the Naxalites, which resulted in the death of hundreds of Naxalites and
                            the imprisonment of more than 20,000 suspects and cadres including senior leaders.The army
                            was also assisted by a brigade of para commandos and the Indian paramilitary. The operation
                            was organised in October 1969, and Lieutenant General J.F.R. Jacob was enjoined by Govind
                            Narain, the home secretary of India, that "there should be no publicity and no records" and
                            Jacob's request to be presented with written orders was also repudiated by Sam Manekshaw</p>

                        <p>An independence movement broke out in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Pakistan">East
                                Pakistan</a> which was crushed by Pakistani forces. Due to large-scale atrocities
                            against them, thousands of Bengalis took refuge in neighbouring India causing a major
                            refugee crisis there. In early 1971, India declared its full-support for the Bengali
                            rebels, known as Mukti Bahini, and Indian agents were extensively involved in covert
                            operations to aid them. </p>

                        <p>On 20 November 1971, the Indian Army moved the 14 Punjab Battalion 45 Cavalry into Garibpur,
                            a strategically important town near India's border with East Pakistan, and successfully
                            captured it. The following day, more clashes took place between Indian and Pakistani
                            forces. Wary of India's growing involvement in the Bengali rebellion, the Pakistan Air
                            Force (PAF) launched a preemptive strike on 10 Indian air bases at: Srinagar, Jammu,
                            Pathankot, Amritsar, Agra, Adampur, Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, Uttarlai and Sirsa at 17:45 hours
                            on 3 December. However, this aerial offensive failed to accomplish its stated objectives,
                            and gave India an excuse to declare a full-scale war against Pakistan the same day. By
                            midnight, the Indian Army, accompanied by the Indian Air Force, launched a major
                            three-pronged assault into East Pakistan. The Indian Army won several battles on the
                            eastern front including the decisive battle of Hilli, which was the only front where the
                            Pakistani Army was able to build up considerable resistance. The operation also included a
                            battalion-level airborne operation on Tangail, which resulted in the capitulation of all
                            resistance within five days. India's massive early gains were attributed largely to the
                            speed and flexibility with which Indian armoured divisions moved across East Pakistan.</p>

                        <p>Pakistan launched a counter-attack against India on the western front. On 4 December 1971,
                            the A company of the 23rd Battalion of India's Punjab Regiment detected and intercepted the
                            movement of the 51st Infantry Brigade of the Pakistani Army near Ramgarh, Rajasthan. The
                            battle of Longewala ensued during which the A company, though being outnumbered, thwarted
                            the Pakistani advance until the Indian Air Force directed its fighters to engage the
                            Pakistani tanks. By the time the battle had ended, 38 Pakistani tanks and 100 armoured
                            vehicles were either destroyed or abandoned. About 200 Pakistani troops were killed in
                            action during the battle while only two Indian soldiers lost their lives. Pakistan suffered
                            another major defeat on the western front during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Basantar">Battle
                                of Bastar</a> which was fought from 4 December to the 16th. By the end of the battle,
                            about 66 Pakistani tanks were destroyed and 40 more were captured. In return, Pakistani
                            forces were able to destroy only 11 Indian tanks. None of the many Pakistani offensives on
                            the western front materialised.[58] By 16 December, Pakistan had lost sizeable territory on
                            both the eastern and western fronts.</p>

                        <p>Under the command of Lt. General J.S. Arora, the three corps of the Indian Army, which had
                            invaded East Pakistan, entered Dhaka and forced Pakistani forces to surrender on 16
                            December 1971, one day after the conclusion of the battle of Basantar. After Pakistan's Lt
                            General A A K Niazi signed the Instrument of Surrender, India took more than 90,000
                            Pakistani prisoners of war. By the time of the signing, 11,000 Pakistani soldiers were
                            killed-in-action while India suffered 3,500 battle-related deaths.[46] In addition,
                            Pakistan lost 220 tanks during the battle compared to India's 69</p>

                        <p>In 1972, the <a href="shimla_agreement.html">Simla Agreement</a> was signed between the two
                            countries and tensions simmered. However,there were occasional spurts in diplomatic
                            tensions which culminated in increased military vigilance on both sides.</p>

                        <strong style="color:darkgoldenrod;">Siachen conflict (1984)</strong><br />
                        <p>The Siachen Glacier, though a part of the Kashmir region, was not officially demarcated on
                            maps prepared and exchanged between the two sides in 1947. As a consequence, prior to the
                            1980s, neither India nor Pakistan maintained any permanent military presence in the region.
                            However, Pakistan began conducting and allowing a series of mountaineering expeditions to
                            the glacier beginning in the 1950s. By the early 1980s, the Government of Pakistan was
                            granting special expedition permits to mountaineers and United States Army maps
                            deliberately showed Siachen as a part of Pakistan. This practice gave rise to the
                            contemporary meaning of the term oropolitics.</p>

                        <p>India, possibly irked by these developments, launched Operation Meghdoot in April 1984. An
                            entire battalion of the Kumaon Regiment was airlifted to the glacier. Pakistani forces
                            responded quickly and clashes between the two followed. The Indian Army secured the
                            strategic Sia La and Bilafond La mountain passes, and by 1985 more than 1,000 square miles
                            (2,600 km2) of territory 'claimed' by Pakistan was under Indian control. The Indian Army
                            continues to control all the Siachen Glacier and its tributary glaciers. Pakistan made
                            several unsuccessful attempts to regain control over Siachen. In late 1987, Pakistan
                            mobilised about 8,000 troops and garrisoned them near Khapalu, aiming to capture Bilafond
                            La. However, they were repulsed by Indian Army personnel guarding Bilafond. During the
                            battle, about 23 Indian soldiers lost their lives, while more than 150 Pakistani troops
                            perished. Further unsuccessful attempts to reclaim positions were launched by Pakistan in
                            1990, 1995, 1996 and 1999, most notably in Kargil that year.</p>

                        <p>India continues to maintain a strong military presence in the region, despite extremely
                            inhospitable conditions. The conflict over Siachen is regularly cited as an example of
                            mountain warfare. The highest peak in the Siachen glacier region, Saltoro Kangri, could be
                            viewed as strategically important for India because of its immense altitude which could
                            enable the Indian forces to monitor some Pakistani or Chinese movements in the immediate
                            area. Maintaining control over Siachen poses several logistical challenges for the Indian
                            Army. Several infrastructure projects were constructed in the region, including a helipad
                            at 21,000 feet (6,400 m) above the sea level. In 2004, the Indian Army was spending an
                            estimated US$2 million a month to support its personnel stationed in the region</p>

                        <strong style="color:darkgoldenrod;">Counter-insurgency activities</strong>
                        <p>The Indian Army has played a crucial role in the past, fighting insurgents and terrorists
                            within the nation. The army launched Operation Blue Star and Operation Woodrose in the
                            1980s to combat Sikh insurgents. The army, along with some paramilitary forces, has the
                            prime responsibility of maintaining law and order in the troubled Jammu and Kashmir region,
                            led specifically by the Northern Command. The Indian Army also sent a contingent to Sri
                            Lanka in 1987 as a part of the Indian Peace Keeping Force. Allied with the work of the
                            Northern Command and its peace time activities is "North Tech Symposium", an annual event,
                            with the aim of providing a viable platform for knowledge diffusion on relevant,
                            contemporary military technologies available as commercial off the shelf (COTS) worldwide.
                            The Indian Army also successfully conducted Operation Golden Bird in 1995 for
                            counter-insurgency in northeast India</p>

                        <strong style="color:darkgoldenrod;">Kargil war (1999)</strong>
                        <p>In 1998, India carried out nuclear tests and a few days later, Pakistan responded with more
                            <a href="nuclear_test.html">neuclear test </a> giving both countries <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_deterrence">Nuclear
                                Deterrence </a> capability, although India had tested one hydrogen bomb which Pakistan
                            lacked. Diplomatic tensions eased after the Lahore Summit was held in 1999. However, the
                            sense of optimism was short-lived since in mid-1999 Pakistani paramilitary forces and
                            Kashmiri insurgents captured the deserted, but strategic, Himalayan heights in the Kargil
                            district of India. These had been vacated by the Indian army during the onset of the
                            inhospitable winter and were supposed to be reoccupied in spring. The regular Pakistani
                            troops who took control of these areas received important support, both in the form of arms
                            and supplies, from Pakistan. Some of the heights under their control, which also included
                            the Tiger Hill, overlooked the vital Srinagar-Leh Highway (NH 1A), Batalik and Dras.</p>

                        <p>Once the scale of the Pakistani incursion was realised, the Indian Army quickly mobilised
                            about 200,000 troops and Operation Vijay was launched. However, since the heights were
                            under Pakistani control, India was at a clear strategic disadvantage. From their
                            observation posts, the Pakistani forces had a clear line-of-sight to lay down indirect
                            artillery fire on NH 1A, inflicting heavy casualties on the Indians. This was a serious
                            problem for the Indian Army as the highway was its main logistical and supply route.Thus,
                            the Indian Army's first priority was to recapture peaks that were in the immediate vicinity
                            of NH 1A. This resulted in Indian troops first targeting the Tiger Hill and Tololing
                            complex in Dras. This was soon followed by more attacks on the Batalik-Turtok sub-sector
                            which provided access to Siachen Glacier. Point 4590, which had the nearest view of the NH
                            1A, was successfully recaptured by Indian forces on 14 June.</p>

                        <p>Though most of the posts in the vicinity of the highway were cleared by mid-June, some parts
                            of it near Drass witnessed sporadic shelling until the end of the war. Once the NH 1A area
                            was cleared, the Indian Army turned to driving the invading force back across the Line of
                            Control. The Battle of Tololing, among other assaults, slowly tilted the combat in India's
                            favour. Nevertheless, some posts put up a stiff resistance, including Tiger Hill (Point
                            5140) that fell only later in the war. As the operation was fully under way, about 250
                            artillery guns were brought in to clear the infiltrators in the posts that were in the
                            line-of-sight. At many vital points, neither artillery nor air power could dislodge the
                            outposts manned by the Pakistan soldiers, who were out of visible range. The Indian Army
                            mounted some direct frontal ground assaults which were slow and took a heavy toll given the
                            steep ascent that had to be made on peaks as high as 18,000 feet (5,500 m). Two months into
                            the conflict, Indian troops had slowly retaken most of the ridges they had lost;according
                            to official count, an estimated 75%–80% of the intruded area, and nearly all high ground,
                            was back under Indian control.</p>

                        <p>Following the Washington accord on 4 July, where Sharif agreed to withdraw Pakistani troops,
                            most of the fighting came to a gradual halt, but some Pakistani forces remained in
                            positions on the Indian side of the LOC. In addition, the United Jihad Council (an umbrella
                            for all extremist groups) rejected Pakistan's plan for a climb-down, instead deciding to
                            fight on. The Indian Army launched its final attacks in the last week of July; as soon as
                            the Drass sub-sector had been cleared of Pakistani forces, the fighting ceased on 26 July.
                            The day has since been marked as Kargil Vijay Diwas (Kargil Victory Day) in India. By the
                            end of the war, India had resumed control of all the territory south and east of the Line
                            of Control, as was established in July 1972 per the Shimla Accord. By the time all
                            hostilities had ended, the number of Indian soldiers killed during the conflict stood at
                            527,while more than 700 regular members of the Pakistani Army were killed.

                <p>There are 65 Armoured Regiments in the Indian Army (including the PBG and 61st Cavalry). These include the following
                historic regiments dating back to the nineteenth century or earlier: 1st (Skinner's) Horse, the 2nd Lancers (Gardner's
                Horse), the 3rd Cavalry, the 4th (Hodson's) Horse, the 7th Light Cavalry, the 8th Light Cavalry, the 9th (Deccan)
                Horse, the 14th (Scinde) Horse, the 17th (Poona) Horse, the 15th Lancers, the 16th Light Cavalry, the 18th Cavalry, the
                20th Lancers and the 21st (Central India) Horse. A substantial number of additional units designated as either
                "Cavalry" or "Armoured" Regiments have been raised since Independence.</p>

                <h3 style="color: red;"><a href="mechanised_infantry.html">Mechanised Infantry</a></h3>
                <p>The Mechanised Infantry is the newest Combat Arm of the Indian Army. Often referred to as "tomorrow's arm in today's Army", it is formed of two Regiments; <a href="brigade_of_gaurds.html">The Brigade of the Guards</a> and <a href="mechanised_infantry_regiment.html">Mechanised infantry regiment</a> and comprises 48 Mechanised Infantry Battalions in all. The brain-child of raising of this arm was that of Gen Krishnaswamy Sundarji, PVSM (28 April 1930 – 8 February 1999), who was the Chief of Army Staff of the Indian Army from 1986 to 1988. During the late 70s, as part of Indian Army modernisation, there was an urgent need to re-calibrate the Indian Mechanised Forces by forming of Mechanised Infantry units to further the shock-action, fire-power, flexibility and mobility of Armoured formations to include ground-holding ability. Thus, the Mechanised Infantry Regiment was born by careful selection of existing Infantry battalions based on operational performance. As the need for more Mechanised battalions grew, the elite Brigade of The Guards were also converted to the Mechanised profile. The two Regiments along with the Armoured Corps form part of the Indian Army's elite "Mechanised Forces".</p>

                <p>Upon its inception, the Indian Army inherited the British Army's organisational structure, which is still maintained today. Therefore, like its predecessor, an Indian infantry regiment's responsibility is not to undertake field operations but to provide battalions and well trained personnel to the field formations. As such it is common to find battalions of the same regiment spread across several brigades, divisions, corps, commands, and even theatres. Like its British and Commonwealth counterparts, troops enlisted within the regiment are immensely loyal, take great pride in the regiment to which they are assigned, and generally spend their entire career within the regiment.</p>

                <p>Most Indian Army infantry regiments recruit based on certain selection criteria, such as on the basis of region (for example, the Assam Regiment), caste/community (Jat Regiment), or religion (Sikh Regiment). Most regiments continue the eritage of regiments raised under the British Raj, but some have been raised after independence. Some regiments raised after independence have specialised in border defence, in particular the Ladakh Scouts, the Arunachal Scouts and the Sikkim Scouts.</p>

                <p>Over the years there have been fears that troops' allegiance lay more with their regiments and the
                regions/castes/communities/religions from which they were recruited, as opposed to the union of India as a whole. Thus some "all India" or "all class" regiments have been created that recruit troops from all over India regardless of region, caste/community or religion, such as the Brigade of the Guards (which later converted to the Mechanised Infantry profile) and the Parachute Regiment.</p>

                    <h4>Artillery</h4>
                    <p>The Regiment of Artillery is the second largest arm of the Indian Army, constituting nearly one sixth of the Army's
                    total strength. Originally raised in 1935 as part of the Royal Indian Artillery of the British Indian Army, the
                    Regiment is now tasked with providing the Army's towed and self-propelled field artillery, including guns, howitzers,
                    heavy mortars, rockets and missiles.</p>

                    <p>As an integral part of nearly all combat operations conducted by the Indian Army, the Regiment of Artillery has a
                    history of being a major contributor to Indian military success. During the Kargil War, it was the Indian Artillery
                    that inflicted the most damage.[122] Over the years, five artillery officers have gone on to the Army's highest post as
                    Chief of Army Staff of the Indian Army.</p>

                    <div class="img14" style="float: left;padding: 2px 2px;background-color:#F8F9FA;font-size:12px;border: groove;">

                        <p>Bofors artillery gun</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>For some time, the Regiment of Artillery commanded a significantly larger share of the Army's personnel than it does
                    now, as it was also responsible for air defense artillery and some aviation assets. The 1990s saw the formation of the
                    Corps of Army Air Defence and the coalescing of all aviation assets into the Army Aviation Corps. The arm is now
                    focused on field artillery, and supplies regiments and batteries to each of the operational commands. The home of the
                    Regiment is in Nashik, Maharashtra, where their headquarters is located along with the service's museum. The School of
                    Artillery of the Indian Army is located nearby in Devlali.</p>

                    <p>After undergoing consistent failures to import or produce modern artillery for three decades, the Regiment of
                    Artillery is finally going ahead with procurement of brand new 130-mm and 150-mm artillery guns. The
                    Army is also putting large numbers of rocket launchers into service, with the indigenously-developed Pinaka multi
                    barrel rocket launcher to equip 22 regiments by the end of the next decade.</p>

                    <h3 style="color:orangered;">Corps of Engineers</h3>
                    <ul class="ul1">
                        <li class="li1">Madaras Engineer Group</li>
                        <li class="li1">Bengal Engineer Group</li>
                        <li class="li1">Bombay Engineer Group</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The Indian Army Corps of Engineers has a long history dating back to the mid-18th century. The earliest existing
                    subunit of the Corps (18 Field Company) dates back to 1777 while the Corps officially recognises its birth as 1780 when
                    the senior most group of the Corps, the Madras Sappers were raised. The Corps consists of three groups of combat
                    engineers, namely the Madras Sappers, the Bengal Sappers and the Bombay Sappers. A group is roughly analogous to a
                    regiment of Indian infantry, each group consisting of a number of engineer regiments. The engineer regiment is the
                    basic combat engineer unit, analogous to an infantry battalion.</p>

                    <h4 style="color:mediumvioletred;">Corps of Signal</h4>
                    <p>Indian Army Corps of Signals is a corps and the arm of the Indian Army which handles its military communications. It
                    was formed on 15 February 1911 as a separate entity under Lieutenant Colonel S H Powell, and went on to make important
                    contributions to World War I and World War II. The corps celebrated its 100-year anniversary of its raising on 15
                    February 2011.</p>

                    <h4 style="color:mediumvioletred;">Army Activation Corps</h4>
                    <p>The Army Aviation Corps, formed on 1 November 1986, is a component of the Indian Army. The aviation arm is headed by a
                    Director General of the rank of Lt General at the Army HQ, New Delhi.</p>

                    <h4 style="color:mediumvioletred;">Corps of Army Air Defence</h4>
                    <p>The Corps of Army Air Defence (abbreviated as AAD) is an active corps of the Indian Army and a major combative
                    formation tasked with air defences of the country from foreign threats. The AAD Corps is responsible for the protection
                    of Indian air space from enemy aircraft and missiles, especially below 5,000 feet.</p>
                    <p>The history of the AAD dates back to 1939 during the times of the British Raj in India. The corps actively took part in
                    the Second World War fighting on behalf of the British Empire. Post independence, the corps has participated in all the
                    wars involving India, starting from the 1947 Indo-Pakistani War to the 1999 Kargil conflict. The corps enjoyed
                    autonomous status from 1994, after the bifurcation of the Corps of Air Defence Artillery from the Army's artillery
                    regiment. A separate training school, the Army Air Defence College (AADC), was established to train its personnel.</p>

                <h4>Training</h4>
                <p>Pre-commission training of Gentlemen Cadets is carried out at the Indian Military Academy at Dehradun and the Officers
                Training Academy at Chennai. There are also specialised training institutions like the Army War College, at Mhow,
                Madhya Pradesh, the High Altitude Warfare School (HAWS), at Gulmarg, Jammu and Kashmir, the Counter Insurgency and
                Jungle Warfare School (CIJW), in Vairengte, Mizoram, and the College of Military Engineering (CME), in Pune. There is
                an Army Training Command (ARTRAC) at Shimla, whose main aim is to maximise the effectiveness of the training of
                personnel.</p>

                <h4>Intelligence</h4>
                <p>The Directorate of Military Intelligence (DMI) is the Intelligence arm of the Indian Army. The MI (as it is commonly
                referred to) was constituted in 1941 and was initially created to check corruption in the Army's own ranks. With time,
                its role has evolved into cross border intelligence, intelligence sharing with friendly nations, infiltrating insurgent
                groups and counter-terrorism. In the late 1970s, the MI was embroiled in the Samba spy scandal wherein three Indian
                Army officers were falsely implicated as Pakistani spies. The organisation has since emerged from the scandal as a
                prime Intelligence organisation of the Indian Army. As of 2012, the MI has seen many of its roles taken away in a turf
                war with the newly created National Technical Research Organisation and the Defence Intelligence Agency. Since it
                was set up in 2004 as a premier apex scientific agency under the National Security Adviser in the Prime Minister's
                Office, it also includes the National Institute of Cryptology Research and Development (NICRD), which is the first of

                <p>The Indian Army is a voluntary service, and although a provision for military conscription exists in the Indian constitution, it has never been imposed. As of 1 July 2017, the Indian Army has a sanctioned strength of 49,932 officers (42,253 serving with 7,679 under strength), and 1,215,049 enlisted personnel (1,194,864 serving with 20,185 under strength). Recently, it has been proposed to enhance the strength of the army by more than 90,000 to counter the increasing presence of Chinese troops along the Line of Actual Control. According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, in 2017 the army had a strength of 1,200,000 active personnel and 960,000 reserve personnel. Of those in reserve, 300,000 are first-line reserve (within 5 years of service), 500,000 are committed till the age of 50 and 160,000 were in the Indian Territorial Army, with 40,000 in regular establishment. This makes the Indian Army the world's largest standing volunteer army.</p>
